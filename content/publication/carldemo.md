abstract = "Understanding cause-and-effect is key for informed decision-making.  The gold standard in causal inference is performing controlled  experiments,  which  may  not  always  be  feasible due to ethical, legal, or cost constraints.  As an alternative, inferring causality from observational data has been extensively  used  in  statistics  and  social  sciences.   However,  the existing methods critically rely on a restrictive assumption that the population of study consists of homogeneous units that can be represented as a single flat table.  In contrast, in many real-world settings, the study domain consists of heterogeneous units that are best represented using relational databases.   We  propose  and  demonstrateCaRL:  an  end-to-end system for drawing causal inference from relational data.  In addition, we built a visual interface to wrap aroundCaRL. In our demonstration, we will use this GUI to show a  live  investigation  of  causal  inference  from  real  academic and medical relational databases."
